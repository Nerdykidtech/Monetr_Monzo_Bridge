   - A browser window will open for Monzo authorization
   - Log in to your Monzo account if needed
   - Approve the connection
   - Check your Monzo app for the authorization request
   - After approving, you'll be redirected back to the application

5. **Start Monitoring**
   - The bridge will automatically start monitoring for new transactions
